Description: Methods to detect differential item functioning (DIF) in dichotomous
    and polytomous items, using both classical and modern approaches. These include
    Mantel-Haenszel procedures, logistic regression (including ordinal models), and
    regularization-based methods such as LASSO. Uniform and non-uniform DIF effects
    can be detected, and some methods support multiple focal groups. The package
    also provides tools for anchor purification, rest score matching, effect size
    estimation, and DIF simulation. See Magis, Beland, Tuerlinckx, and De Boeck
    (2010, Behavior Research Methods, 42, 847â€“862, <doi:10.3758/BRM.42.3.847>) for
    a general overview.
